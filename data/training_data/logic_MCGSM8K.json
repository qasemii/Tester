[{"question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? (A) 144 (B) 8640 (C) 10 (D) 9.", "gold_answer": "C", "reasonings": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Rate of Pay**: Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting. This means for every 60 minutes she works, she earns $12.\n\n2. **Calculating Earnings for 50 Minutes**: Since Weng worked for 50 minutes, we need to calculate her earnings for this duration. To do this, we find out how much she earns per minute and then multiply it by the number of minutes she worked.\n   \n   - Her hourly rate is $12 for 60 minutes.\n   - So, her per-minute rate is $12 / 60 = $0.20 per minute.\n   - For 50 minutes of work, she earns 50 * $0.20 = $10.\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting, which corresponds to option (C).\n\nNow, addressing the logical part of your question regarding `~q->~p` (if not q, then not p), where `p` is the premise (the question about how much Weng earns) and `q` is the conclusion (the amount she earns):\n\n- `p` (the question) is: Weng earns $12 an hour and worked for 50 minutes, how much did she earn?\n- `q` (the answer) is: $10.\n\nThe statement `~q->~p` implies that if the conclusion (Weng earning $10) is not true (`~q`), then the premise (the question about her earnings based on her hourly rate and time worked) is also not true (`~p`).\n\nHowever, the logic here is a bit tricky because the conclusion (`q`) directly follows from the premise (`p`) through a mathematical calculation, not a logical implication that can be directly negated in the context provided. The calculation shows that given Weng's hourly rate and the time she worked, she indeed earns $10, making option (C) correct based on the mathematical calculation, not the logical rule `~q->~p` directly.\n\nIn essence, the question seems to conflate mathematical calculation with logical implication. The correct answer, `$10`, is derived from dividing Weng's hourly rate by 60 to find her per-minute rate and then multiplying by the minutes worked, not from applying the logical rule `~q->~p`."}]
