Since 12 hours is 720 minutes, and she only worked 50 minutes, this is far too large. Option A is incorrect because it assumes an unrealistic amount of time worked.", "B": "B: To earn $8640 at $12 per hour, Weng would need to work $\\frac{8640}{12} = 720$ hours, which is 720 \u00d7 60 = 43,200 minutes. This is an extremely large amount of time, far exceeding 50 minutes. Option B is incorrect due to the absurdly high value.", "C": "C: As calculated, $ 12 \\times \\frac{50}{60} = 12 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = 10 $. This matches the time worked (50 minutes) and the hourly rate ($12). Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the earnings for 50 minutes of work.", "D": "D: To earn $9 at $12 per hour, Weng would need to work $ \\frac{9}{12} = 0.75 $ hours, or 0.75 \u00d7 60 = 45 minutes.

She initially had half of the $100, which is $50. Her parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice as much, which is $30. So, in total, she received $15 + $30 = $45 from her parents and grandparents. Adding this to her initial $50 gives her $50 + $45 = $95, which is $5 more than needed to require $55 more. This calculation does not match the given information, as it results in her having more money than expected. However, reevaluating the initial amount she had and the contributions, if she had $50 and received $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents, she would have $50 + $15 + $30 = $95. This means she actually has more than needed if she only required $55 more to reach $100, indicating a miscalculation in the reasoning process regarding the option's correctness based on the initial setup. The correct approach should directly assess the total amount Betty has after receiving money from her parents and grandparents and compare it to the cost of the wallet to determine how much more she needs. Given that she starts with $50 (half of $100), and receives $15 from her parents and $30 from her grandparents, totaling $45 in gifts, she would have $50 + $45 = $95. Since the wallet costs $100, she needs $100 - $95 = $5 more, not $55, indicating the initial interpretation of option B was incorrect in the context of validating its correctness through backward reasoning.", "C": "C: If Betty needs $20 more, she currently has $100 - $20 = $80. She initially had half of the money, which is $100 / 2 = $50. Her parents gave her $15, and her grandparents gave her twice as much, which is $15 * 2 = $30. So, she received $15 + $30 = $45. Adding this to the initial $50, she indeed has $50 + $45 = $95, but since she needs $100 and $95 - $100 = -$5, this would mean she has $95, which is $5 more than needed if she had $80 + $20 - $5 = $95. However, the calculation shows she would have $95, which is close but the question states she needs $20 more if she has $80, so let's recheck: $50 (initial) + $15 (parents) + $30 (grandparents) = $95. If she needs $20 more to reach $100 and she has $95 - $20 = $75, then the initial calculation seems off because we assumed she had $80. The correct sequence should be: if she needs $20 more, then she has $100 - $20 = $80, but the gifts and her initial savings total $50 + $45 = $95, indicating an inconsistency in assuming the $20 more needed directly.

Adding this to her initial $50 gives $50 + $45 = $95, but she only has $45 + $50 (initial) - $100 (price) = $-5 + $45 (gifts) = $45 - $55 (needed) = $50 (initial) - $5 = $45 + $15 + $30 = $90, which is $10 short of $100, not $55 short.

Yesterday and today, she read 12 + 12 * 2 = 36 pages. So, before tomorrow, she had 120 - 36 = 84 pages left. Half of 84 is indeed 42, but she plans to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, which should be half of 84, not 48. However, since 24 is half of 48, let's check if 48 is the correct number of pages remaining before tomorrow. If 48 pages are remaining before tomorrow, then before yesterday and today, she had 120 pages, and after reading 36 pages, she indeed had 120 - 36 = 84 pages. But she should read half of the remaining pages, which is 84 / 2 = 42, not 24. This is a conflict. However, the question asks to assume (A) is correct and apply backward reasoning. If she reads 24 pages tomorrow, then she had 24 * 2 = 48 pages before tomorrow. Since she read 36 pages before tomorrow, she had 120 - 36 = 84 pages, which is correct because 84 - 24 * 2 is not equal to 24 * 2, but 84 / 2 is not equal to 24. However, 48 is the number of pages that would be left after reading 24 pages, not before. So, if she reads 24 pages, then before tomorrow, she had 24 + 24 = 48 pages left after reading 36 pages, which is incorrect because she had 84 pages left after reading 36 pages. The correct number of pages she should read is half of the remaining pages after reading 36 pages, which is 84 / 2 = 42, but the question asks to assume (A) is correct. If she had 48 pages before reading 24 pages, then she had 48 + 24 = 72 pages before reading 24 pages, which is incorrect because she had 84 pages after reading 36 pages. So, she should have 72 + 36 = 108 pages before reading 36 pages, which is incorrect because she had 120 pages. However, the question states she had 120 pages.
