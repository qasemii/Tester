[{"question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? (A) 144 (B) 8640 (C) 10 (D) 9.", "gold_answer": "C", "reasonings": {"A": "To solve this problem, we first need to understand that Weng earns $12 for 60 minutes of babysitting since her rate is given per hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour.\n\nGiven that Weng earns $12 for 60 minutes, we can calculate her earnings per minute as follows:\n$12 / 60 minutes = $0.20 per minute\n\nSince she worked for 50 minutes, her total earnings can be calculated as:\n50 minutes * $0.20 per minute = $10\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting. The correct answer is (C) $10.\n\nNow, to address the logical formulation part of your question, let's break it down:\n\nIf p -> q, then it means \"if p, then q.\" In this context, p could be \"Weng worked for 50 minutes\" and q could be \"Weng earned $10.\"\n\nThe logical formulation ~q -> ~p means \"if not q, then not p,\" which translates to \"if Weng did not earn $10, then she did not work for 50 minutes.\"\n\nSo, applying the given options to this logic:\n- If we consider option (C) $10 as q (the correct earnings), then ~q would mean Weng did not earn $10.\n- ~p would mean Weng did not work for 50 minutes.\n\nTherefore, ~q -> ~p in this context means that if Weng did not earn $10 (which is the correct amount for 50 minutes of work), then the premise that she worked for 50 minutes (which led to the conclusion that she earned $10) must be false. This logical formulation helps us understand the relationship between the condition (working for 50 minutes) and the consequence (earning $10), but it does not directly calculate the earnings. The actual calculation of earnings is based on the hourly rate and the time worked.", "B": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting.\n2. Yesterday, she did 50 minutes of babysitting.\n3. To find out how much she earned, we need to convert the 50 minutes into hours since her rate is per hour.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour. So, 50 minutes is equal to 50 / 60 = 5/6 of an hour.\n\nNow, let's calculate her earnings:\n- Earnings per hour = $12\n- Time worked in hours = 50 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5/6 hour\n- Earnings for 50 minutes = $12 * (5/6) = $10\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\n\nGiven the options:\n(A) 144\n(B) 8640\n(C) 10\n(D) 9\n\nThe correct answer is (C) $10.\n\nNow, to formulate ~q->~p as requested, where q is the answer and p is the question:\n\nLet p be \"Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting and she worked for 50 minutes.\"\nLet q be \"She earned $8640.\"\n\n~q means \"She did not earn $8640.\"\n~p means \"Either Weng does not earn $12 an hour for babysitting, or she did not work for 50 minutes.\"\n\nSo, ~q->~p translates to: \"If she did not earn $8640, then either Weng does not earn $12 an hour for babysitting, or she did not work for 50 minutes.\"\n\nThis logical statement is true because if she didn't earn $8640 (which is the case, as we've calculated her earnings to be $10), it implies that the conditions (either her hourly rate or the time she worked) must be different from what was initially stated to lead to such an incorrect earning amount.", "C": "To determine how much Weng earned, we first need to establish her hourly rate and the portion of an hour she worked. Weng earns $12 an hour, and she worked for 50 minutes.\n\n1. Convert the minutes worked into hours: Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is 50 / 60 = 5/6 of an hour.\n\n2. Calculate her earnings: Multiply her hourly rate by the fraction of the hour she worked. So, $12 * (5/6) = $10.\n\nThus, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting, making option (C) the correct answer.\n\nNow, applying the logical formulation ~q->~p to this scenario:\n\n- Let p be the statement: \"Weng worked for 50 minutes at $12 an hour.\"\n- Let q be the statement: \"Weng earned $10.\"\n\nThe original implication is p->q, meaning \"If Weng worked for 50 minutes at $12 an hour, then she earned $10.\"\n\nThe negation of q (~q) would be: \"Weng did not earn $10.\"\n\nThe negation of p (~p) would be: \"Weng did not work for 50 minutes at $12 an hour.\"\n\nSo, ~q->~p translates to: \"If Weng did not earn $10, then she did not work for 50 minutes at $12 an hour.\"\n\nThis logical statement essentially says that if the outcome (earning $10) did not occur, then the initial condition (working 50 minutes at $12 an hour) must not have occurred either, which aligns with the calculation and reasoning provided to determine Weng's earnings.", "D": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 50 minutes is equal to 50/60 = 5/6 hours.\n\nNext, we can calculate her earnings by multiplying the number of hours she worked by her hourly wage:\n\nEarnings = Hourly wage * Number of hours worked\n= $12 * (5/6)\n= $10\n\nSo, Weng earned $10 for 50 minutes of babysitting.\n\nThe correct answer is (C) $10.\n\nNow, let's formulate ~q->~p as requested:\n\nIf q is the answer \"$9\" (which is option D and stated to be incorrect), and p is the question about how much Weng earned, then:\n\n~q means \"not $9\" (which implies the correct answer is not $9)\n~p means \"Weng did not earn the amount stated in the question\" (however, since the question is about calculating her earnings based on given data, ~p would imply that the calculation or the premises are incorrect).\n\nSo, ~q->~p translates to: \"If Weng did not earn $9, then the question's premises or calculation are incorrect.\"\n\nGiven that we've calculated Weng's earnings to be $10, the statement ~q->~p holds because the correct earnings ($10) indeed indicate that the $9 option is incorrect, and our calculation confirms that the premises and calculation lead to the conclusion that she did not earn $9."}}, {"question": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100.

But since our calculations show Albert eating all the pizzas results in 48 slices, option (C) is the correct choice.", "B": "To find out how many pieces Albert eats, we need to calculate the total number of slices from the large and small pizzas.\n\nA large pizza has 16 slices, and Albert buys 2 large pizzas, so the total number of slices from the large pizzas is 2 * 16 = 32 slices.\n\nA small pizza has 8 slices, and Albert buys 2 small pizzas, so the total number of slices from the small pizzas is 2 * 8 = 16 slices.\n\nAdding the slices from the large and small pizzas together, we get 32 + 16 = 48 slices.\n\nNow, to apply the logical formulation ~q->~p, where p is the statement \"Albert eats a certain amount of pizza\" and q is the answer \"80 slices,\" we are testing the incorrect option (B) 80 slices.\n\nThe statement q is \"Albert eats 80 slices of pizza.\"\nThe negation of q, ~q, would be \"Albert does not eat 80 slices of pizza.\"\n\nGiven that Albert actually eats 48 slices (as calculated), we can say ~q is true because he does not eat 80 slices.\n\nThe original statement p is \"Albert eats the amount of pizza calculated from the pizzas he bought.\"\nThe negation of p, ~p, would be \"Albert does not eat the amount of pizza calculated from the pizzas he bought.\"\n\nNow, applying the logic ~q->~p with our values:\n- ~q is \"Albert does not eat 80 slices of pizza,\" which is true based on our calculation (he eats 48 slices).\n- If ~q is true, then according to the logic rule, ~p should also be true. However, our calculation directly gives us the amount Albert eats (48 slices), making the statement p (\"Albert eats the amount of pizza calculated\") true.\n\nThus, the correct formulation and its implication in this context serve to validate the calculation method rather than directly applying to the calculation itself. The correct answer, based on our initial calculation, is (C) 48 slices. \n\nTo directly apply the logical formulation to the given options and the calculated answer:\n- If the answer (q) is not 80 slices (~q), then the premise (p) that Albert eats the calculated amount is indeed true, and thus ~q (not 80 slices) leads to the affirmation of p (he eats 48 slices), not the negation of p. This logical exercise was more about understanding the implication of an incorrect answer rather than deriving the correct answer through logic alone.", "C": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Albert buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas.\n2. A large pizza has 16 slices, so 2 large pizzas have 2 * 16 = 32 slices.\n3. A small pizza has 8 slices, so 2 small pizzas have 2 * 8 = 16 slices.\n4. In total, Albert has 32 (from large pizzas) + 16 (from small pizzas) = 48 slices.\n\nTherefore, if Albert eats all the pizzas, he eats 48 slices that day.\n\nNow, to formulate ~q->~p, where p is the question \"How many pieces does Albert eat that day?\" and q is the answer \"48 slices,\" we can say:\n\n~q means \"not 48 slices,\" and ~p means \"Albert does not eat that many pieces that day.\"\n\nSo, ~q->~p can be stated as: \"If Albert does not eat 48 slices, then he does not eat the total number of slices from 2 large and 2 small pizzas that day.\"\n\nIn logical terms, this translates to: \"If the number of slices eaten is not 48, then the scenario of eating all slices from 2 large and 2 small pizzas does not occur.\"", "D": "To solve this problem, let's first calculate the total number of slices Albert can eat.\n\n2 large pizzas have 2 * 16 = 32 slices.\n2 small pizzas have 2 * 8 = 16 slices.\nSo, in total, Albert can eat 32 + 16 = 48 slices.\n\nNow, if we consider the options given and the logical statement ~q->~p (if not q, then not p), where q represents the answer choices and p represents the scenario of Albert eating all the pizza, we can evaluate the options.\n\nLet's negate each option (q) and see if it leads us to negate the scenario (p), which is Albert eating all the pizzas.\n\n- Option (A) 56: If Albert does not eat 56 slices (~q), it does not necessarily mean he didn't eat all the pizzas (~p), because 56 is not the correct total.\n- Option (B) 80: If Albert does not eat 80 slices (~q), it implies he didn't eat all the pizzas if 80 were the correct total, but since 80 is not correct, this doesn't directly negate p.\n- Option (C) 48: If Albert does not eat 48 slices (~q), then he didn't eat all the pizzas (~p), because 48 is the correct total number of slices.\n- Option (D) 96: If Albert does not eat 96 slices (~q), it doesn't necessarily mean he didn't eat all the pizzas (~p), because 96 is not the correct total.\n\nGiven the correct calculation is 48 slices, the logical formulation ~q->~p for the correct answer would be: If Albert does not eat 48 slices, then he did not eat all the pizzas. This aligns with the calculation that the total number of slices is indeed 48. \n\nSo, the correct answer is (C) 48."}}]
