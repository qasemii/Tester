[{"question": "Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn? (A) 144 (B) 8640 (C) 10 (D) 9.", "gold_answer": "C", "reasonings": {"A": "Option (A) is incorrect because Weng earns $12 per hour, which is equivalent to $12 per 60 minutes. For 50 minutes of babysitting, she would earn a fraction of her hourly wage, not $144, which is an excessively high amount for less than an hour of work. To find her earnings, we would need to calculate her wage per minute and then multiply it by 50 minutes.", "B": "Option (B) is incorrect because Weng earns $12 per hour, and she only worked for 50 minutes, which is less than an hour. To earn $8640, she would need to work for 720 hours ($8640 / $12 per hour), which is equivalent to 43,200 minutes (720 hours * 60 minutes per hour). Since 50 minutes is significantly less than 43,200 minutes, option (B) is not a plausible answer.", "C": "To find out how much Weng earned, we need to calculate her earnings for 50 minutes of babysitting. Since she earns $12 per hour, we first convert the hour to minutes: 1 hour = 60 minutes. \n\nSo, her earnings per minute = $12 / 60 minutes = $0.20 per minute. \n\nFor 50 minutes of babysitting, she earned = $0.20 per minute * 50 minutes = $10.\n\nTherefore, option (C", "D": "Option (D) is incorrect because Weng earns $12 per hour, which is equivalent to $12 / 60 = $0.20 per minute. For 50 minutes of babysitting, she would earn 50 * $0.20 = $10. Since she worked for 50 minutes, which is less than an hour, her earnings would be less than $12, but more than half of $12, which is $6. $9 is less than $10, so"}}, {"question": "Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100.
