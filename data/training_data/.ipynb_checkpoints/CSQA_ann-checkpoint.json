A conflicting example to disregard option B \"enforce\" is: The new policy will enforce strict rules, but in this context, the sanctions did not enforce the school's efforts. \n\nThe correct answer is (A) ignore.", "C": "The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to undermine the efforts the school had made to change, which is more closely related to option (A) ignore, in the sense that the sanctions appeared to disregard or overlook the school's efforts. \n\nA conflicting example to disregard option (C) authoritarian could be: The school's shift towards a more democratic decision-making process was at odds with the authoritarian tone the sanctions implied. \n\nReason: The example shows that the term \"authoritarian\" does not fit the context of the sentence as it describes a style of governance rather than an action taken in response to the school's efforts.", "D": "The correct answer is (A) ignore. \n\nExample: The new policy seemed to ignore the concerns of the student body. \n\nThis shows that \"ignore\" can be used in the context of disregarding or dismissing efforts, which fits the sentence. \n\nIn contrast, an example that disregards option (D) yell at: \nThe school's apology seemed to yell at the very students they were trying to make amends with is not a suitable fit, as \"yell at\" implies a direct and forceful confrontation, rather than disregarding efforts.", "E": "The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to undermine the efforts the school had made to change, which is similar to option (A) ignore, in the sense that both imply a lack of consideration for the school's efforts. \n\nConflicting example: The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to nullify the efforts the school had made to change, which directly conflicts with option (E) avoid, as \"nullify\" implies a direct impact, whereas \"avoid\" implies a lack of impact."}}, {"question": "Sammy wanted to go to where the people were.
