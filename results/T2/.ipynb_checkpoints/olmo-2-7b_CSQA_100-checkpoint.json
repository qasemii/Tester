Feeding someone grapes is a common activity in settings where food is shared, such as at a dinner table or as a gesture of affection. Such an action is not typically associated with a field, bathroom, Michigan, or Minnesota, but rather with a setting where eating and sharing food is customary, such as during a meal or as a special occasion.
