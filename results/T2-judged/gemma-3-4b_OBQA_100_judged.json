Over time, their mineralized remains (primarily calcite and quartz) were buried in sediment, most commonly sand, which then hardened into stone. \n\nWater played a role in the initial formation of the shells, but sand provided the protective covering that fossilized them.", "answer": "B"}, {"question": "A dog is more likely to shiver at (A) 5 am (B) 1 pm", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) 5 am**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nShivering in dogs is a physiological response to cold. 5 am is typically the coldest part of the day, especially during colder months, making a dog more likely to shiver for warmth. 1 pm is usually warmer. \n\nWould you like me to elaborate on why shivering works or the factors that influence a dog's temperature regulation?", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "Photosynthesis does what by converting carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into carbohydrates? (A) providing nourishment which enables some growth to vegetation (B) nourishes small protein bits that need to eat with tiny shakes", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The correct answer is **(A) providing nourishment which enables some growth to vegetation.**\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to create their own food (carbohydrates), which fuels their growth and provides them with energy. \n\nOption (B) is completely incorrect and doesn\u2019t relate to the process of photosynthesis.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "where might a bunny live? (A) a thicket (B) a deserted island.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) a thicket**. \n\nBunnies are woodland creatures that often live in dense bushes and thickets for shelter and to hide from predators. A deserted island wouldn't provide them with the necessary cover.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A shark will be unable to survive on eating algae and moss, because (A) it is a predator (B) it is a producer.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) it is a predator**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n* **Predators** eat other animals for food. Sharks are apex predators that hunt and consume other marine life.\n* **Producers** (like algae and moss) create their own food through photosynthesis. Sharks cannot perform this process. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a more detailed explanation!", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A meadow vole just gave birth, and needs to feed herself so that she can produce milk for her babies. She searches for food in a field, and happily munches down on some (A) bugs (B) recycled plastic fruit.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) bugs**. Meadow voles primarily eat insects like bugs to get the protein and nutrients they need to produce milk for their young. Recycled plastic fruit is not food for a vole.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "The Grand Canyon was formed by (A) a river named after the 38th state to join the union flowing over time (B) a river named after the 20th state to join the union flowing over time", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The correct answer is **(B) a river named after the 20th state to join the union flowing over time.**\n\nThe Colorado River, named after the state of Colorado (the 38th state), is the primary force behind the Grand Canyon\u2019s formation through erosion over millions of years.", "answer": "N/A"}, {"question": "A woman, with a pale complexion, wants to spend the bright, sunny day at the beach. She makes sure that she stops at the store to pick up some sunblock before she begins to enjoy her day filled with sand and surf. She applies the sunblock carefully and thoroughly, because she knows that (A) UV rays are harmful (B) sunlight will be fun", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) UV rays are harmful**.\n\nThe woman\u2019s pale complexion and the need to apply sunblock indicate a concern about the damaging effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.  She\u2019s taking preventative measures to protect her skin.  (B) is irrelevant to her action.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A person is heating water in order to cook pasta. He spills the pot of water on his leg and finds that the water (A) scalds (B) cools", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) scalds**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nHot water causes a rapid transfer of heat to the skin, leading to a painful burning sensation \u2013 that\u2019s a scald.  Cooling wouldn\u2019t happen immediately when spilled.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "Pasta may be cooked in water when (A) water is bubbling from applied warmth (B) the water is warm", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The correct answer is **(A) water is bubbling from applied warmth**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Bubbling water** indicates that the water has reached its boiling point and has the energy to cook the pasta. Simply having warm water isn't enough \u2013 it needs to be actively boiling.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A decrease in diseases (A) leads to less sick people (B) leads to an uptick in emergency room visits.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(B) leads to an uptick in emergency room visits.**\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhen diseases decrease, people are generally healthier and less likely to need immediate medical attention.  Therefore, fewer people seek care in the ER for acute illnesses or injuries.  The statement is a counterintuitive one, highlighting a shift in where people seek care \u2013 from preventative medicine to reactive treatment.", "answer": "N/A"}, {"question": "When soil is viewed in a scientific way, what is seen and viewed is actually (A) tiny lifeforms in dirt (B) a lot of tiny pebbles.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) tiny lifeforms in dirt**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nSoil isn\u2019t just inert material.
