They stuff their cheek pouches full and then bury the acorns for winter.", "answer": "B"}, {"question": "A pot of pasta is boiling on the stove, and the lid on top of the pot is shaking as the water boils more rapidly. A person goes to the stove and removes the pot, releasing steam into the air above, and so the steam is (A) water vapor (B) boiling water.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) water vapor**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nWhen water boils, it changes from a liquid to a gas \u2013 that\u2019s steam. Removing the lid allows the steam to escape into the air. \u201cBoiling water\u201d is the *process* of becoming steam, not the state of the steam itself.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A plant that gets extra minerals such as zinc are probably (A) placed in good soil (B) planted in zinc pills", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) placed in good soil**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n* **Good soil** naturally contains a variety of minerals, including zinc, that plants need to thrive.\n* **Zinc pills** are a highly concentrated, artificial source of zinc \u2013 it\u2019s an unusual and unnecessary method for a healthy plant. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a more detailed explanation!", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "Which item has a higher altitude?

(A) Water (B) Sand.", "gold_answer": "B", "pred": "The answer is **(B) Sand**.\n\nTrilobites were ancient marine arthropods (related to insects and crustaceans).  Over millions of years, their soft bodies were often buried in sediment, primarily sand, which then hardened into stone, preserving their fossilized remains. \n\nWater played a role in the initial burial and preservation, but sand was the key material that formed the protective layer and ultimately fossilized them.", "answer": "B"}, {"question": "A dog is more likely to shiver at (A) 5 am (B) 1 pm", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) 5 am**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nShivering in dogs is a physiological response to cold. 5 am is typically the coldest part of the day, especially during colder months, making a dog more likely to shiver for warmth. 1 pm is usually warmer. \n\nWould you like me to elaborate on why shivering works or the factors that influence a dog's temperature regulation?", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "Photosynthesis does what by converting carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into carbohydrates? (A) providing nourishment which enables some growth to vegetation (B) nourishes small protein bits that need to eat with tiny shakes", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The correct answer is **(A) providing nourishment which enables some growth to vegetation.**\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to create their own food (carbohydrates) \u2013 essentially sugars \u2013 which fuel their growth and provide them with energy. \n\nOption (B) is completely incorrect and doesn\u2019t relate to the process of photosynthesis.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "where might a bunny live? (A) a thicket (B) a deserted island.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) a thicket**. \n\nBunnies are woodland creatures that often live in dense bushes and thickets for shelter and to hide from predators. A deserted island wouldn't provide them with the necessary cover.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A shark will be unable to survive on eating algae and moss, because (A) it is a predator (B) it is a producer.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is **(A) it is a predator**.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n* **Predators** eat other animals for food. Sharks are apex predators that hunt and consume other marine life.\n* **Producers** (like algae and moss) create their own food through photosynthesis. Sharks cannot perform this process. \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a more detailed explanation!", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "A meadow vole just gave birth, and needs to feed herself so that she can produce milk for her babies.
