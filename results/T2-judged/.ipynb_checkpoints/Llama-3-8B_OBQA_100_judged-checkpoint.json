(A) human planet rotation (B) moon rotation.", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The correct answer is (A) Earth's rotation.\n\nAs the Earth rotates on its axis, different stars appear to rise and set in the sky. The star that is nearest to the Earth at a given time is called the \"zenith star\". Since the Earth rotates from west to east, the star that is overhead at midnight (when the Earth is on the opposite side of its rotation) will be on the horizon at noon (when the Earth has rotated 12 hours to the east). Therefore, the middle of the day (noon) is when the star that is nearest to the Earth is straight overhead.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "It's easier for human's to survive in: (A) a town (B) a town", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "I think there may be a mistake in the question!\n\nAssuming the question is asking about the two options, I'd say the answer is (A) a town.

(A) the apple sitting on a sunny sidewalk (B) the apple sitting on a sunny sidewalk", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "A clever question!\n\nThe answer is (A) the apple sitting on a sunny sidewalk.\n\nHere's why: The molecules in the apple are moving rapidly due to the thermal energy they possess, which is a result of the apple's temperature. Since the apple is sitting on a sunny sidewalk, it is absorbing heat from the sun, causing its temperature to rise. As a result, the molecules in the apple will be moving more rapidly due to the increased thermal energy.\n\nIn contrast, the apple sitting on a shaded area or in a cooler environment would have a lower temperature and slower-moving molecules.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "What is used for sensing visual things?

After the party, the balloons are left in the living room, where a fireplace is heating the room. The balloons (A) shrink (B) expand", "gold_answer": "B", "pred": "The correct answer is (A) shrink.\n\nWhen the balloons are filled with helium, they are at a higher temperature than the surrounding air. As they are left in the living room near the fireplace, they are exposed to warmer air, which causes the helium molecules to move faster and expand. However, as the helium molecules gain energy and speed, they also start to transfer their energy to the surrounding air molecules, causing the air molecules to vibrate more rapidly and expand.\n\nAs a result, the air in the room expands and the pressure decreases. Since the helium molecules are now moving faster and transferring their energy to the surrounding air, the pressure inside the balloon decreases, causing the balloon to shrink.", "answer": "A"}, {"question": "Seals are most likely to be found in what type of environment?

(A) direct (B) inverse", "gold_answer": "B", "pred": "The correct answer is (B) inverse.\n\nAs the speed of an object increases, the amount of friction between the object and the surface it's moving on typically decreases. This is because the force of friction is proportional to the normal force (the force perpendicular to the surface) and the coefficient of friction, but as the speed increases, the normal force decreases due to the increased kinetic energy of the object. Therefore, the amount of friction and the speed of an object have an inverse relationship.", "answer": "B"}, {"question": "A fallen leaf (A) will begin to recycle the nutrients that made up its structure (B) will begin to recycle the nutrients that made up its structure", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "The answer is (B) will begin to recycle the nutrients that made up its structure.\n\nWhen a leaf falls, it starts to decompose, and the nutrients it contains, such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and other essential elements, are released back into the soil.
