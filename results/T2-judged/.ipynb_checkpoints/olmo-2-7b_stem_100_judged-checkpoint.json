[{"question": "Statement 1 | A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}. Statement 2 | Q is an ideal in R. (A) False, True (B) True, False", "gold_answer": "A", "pred": "Statement 1: The statement \"A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}\" is true. \n\nExplanation: A ring homomorphism \\( \\varphi: R \\to S \\) is said to be one-to-one (or injective) if for any two elements \\( a, b \\in R \\), \\( \\varphi(a) = \\varphi(b) \\) implies \\( a = b \\). The kernel of the homomorphism \\( \\varphi \\), denoted as \\( \\ker(\\varphi) \\), is the set of all elements in \\( R \\) that are mapped to the zero element in \\( S \\). \n\nAccording to the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, if \\( \\varphi: R \\to S \\) is a ring homomorphism with \\( \\varphi \\) being one-to-one, then \\( R/\\ker(\\varphi) \\cong \\text{Im}(\\varphi) \\), where \\( \\text{Im}(\\varphi) \\) denotes the image of \\( \\varphi \\). If \\( \\ker(\\varphi) = \\{0\\} \\), then \\( R/\\{0\\} \\cong \\text{Im}(\\varphi) \\), which means \\( \\text{Im}(\\varphi) \\) is isomorphic to the whole ring \\( R \\). This implies that \\( \\varphi \\) is one-to-one.\n\nStatement 2: The statement \"Q is an ideal in R.\" (A) False, True\n\nWithout additional context, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \"Q is an ideal in R\" is true or false. An ideal \\( Q \\) in a ring \\( R \\) is a subset of \\( R \\) that satisfies the following properties:\n\n1. If \\( a \\in Q \\) and \\( r \\in R \\), then \\( ar \\in Q \\) and \\( ra \\in Q \\).\n2. \\( Q + Q \\subseteq Q \\) (closure under addition).\n3. If \\( r \\in R \\), then \\( r \\cdot Q \\subseteq Q \\).\n\nIf \\( Q \\) does not satisfy these properties, then \\( Q \\) is not an ideal in \\( R \\). If \\( Q \\) does satisfy these properties, then \\( Q \\) is an ideal in \\( R \\).\n\nGiven only the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine the truth value of statement (B) \"True, False\" without additional context about the specific rings \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\). Therefore, the answer to statement (B) is indeterminate based on the given information. \n\nFor statement (A), since we cannot determine whether \"Q is an ideal in R\" is true or false without further context, the answer is also indeterminate. However, if we were to assume that the statement is asking for the format of the answer based on the structure provided, and since \"True, False\" is not a valid format for a binary true/false question, the most appropriate answer would be to indicate that the information provided is insufficient to determine the truth value of statement (B). \n\nIn a formal setting, one might write:\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: Insufficient information to determine truth value\n\nHowever, since the format requested is to choose between \"False\" and \"True,\" and given the ambiguity, the most fitting response would be to acknowledge the lack of sufficient information to make a definitive choice, which is not directly provided in the options. Thus, the answer to the question as posed is:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: Cannot be determined from the given information", "answer": "B"}, {"question": "Statement 1 | If H is a subgroup of G and a belongs to G then |aH| = |Ha|. Statement 2 | If H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint. (A) False, True (B) True, False", "gold_answer": "B", "pred": "The statement |aH| = |Ha| in group theory is true, and this is a fundamental property of groups and subgroups. This property indicates that the left coset aH (formed by multiplying every element of H by a from the left) and the right coset Ha (formed by multiplying every element of a by H from the right) have the same cardinality (number of elements). This is a direct consequence of the definition of cosets and the properties of group actions.\n\nStatement 2, however, is false. The assertion that if H is a subgroup of G and a and b belong to G, then aH and Hb are identical or disjoint, is incorrect. Cosets in general do not have to be identical or disjoint. They can be identical if a and b are in H (since Hb = aH in this case), but they can also be distinct even if a and b are in G. For example, consider G to be the group of integers under addition and H to be the subgroup of integers that are multiples of 2 (i.e., H = {0, 2, 4, ...}). Then, the cosets 2H and 3H are 2*{0, 2, 4, ...} = {0, 2, 4, ...} and 3*{0, 2, 4, ...} = {0, 3, 6, ...}, which are clearly distinct and not identical.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is:\n\n(B) True, False", "answer": "B"}]
