(A) Attention to sewage control and hygiene (B) Killed polio vaccine (C) Live polio vaccine (D) Combination of the killed and live vaccines.", "gold_answer": "A", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "Polio can be eradicated by a combination of the killed and live vaccines because the killed vaccine provides immunity without causing the disease, while the live vaccine provides strong immunity and also helps in interrupting transmission."}, "2": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "Attention to sewage control and hygiene can help reduce the spread of polio, but on its own, it is not sufficient to eradicate the disease. Eradication requires a comprehensive approach including vaccination."}}}, {"question": "SARS is described as a zoonotic virus - what does this mean? (A) Such viruses are confined to animals (B) They do not cause disease in humans (C) They emerge from animals to cross the species barrier infrequently (D) They cause pandemics", "gold_answer": "A", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "C", "explanation": "SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, is a zoonotic virus, meaning it originates in animals but can cross the species barrier to infect humans. This crossing happens infrequently, leading to outbreaks that can become pandemics if the virus is highly transmissible."}, "2": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "Zoonotic viruses, like SARS, can cause pandemics because they have the potential to spread rapidly among humans, especially if the virus is easily transmitted person-to-person."}}}, {"question": "There is no vaccine against HIV because of which of the following? (A) The virus is so antigenically variable (B) Such a vaccine would be too expensive (C) The virus can be controlled by a change in sexual habits (D) Latency can abrogate any vaccine effect", "gold_answer": "B", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "The virus is highly antigenically variable, which makes it difficult to create a vaccine that can effectively target different strains."}, "2": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "The latent phase of HIV allows the virus to remain dormant and evade the immune system, making it challenging for a vaccine to prevent infection."}}}, {"question": "What is the current best option for preventing future outbreaks of Ebola? (A) Rebuild scientific, medical and nursing infrastructure and train staff (B) Early and accurate diagnosis with molecular kits (C) Develop effective vaccines (D) Arrange rapid intervention into West Africa with EU and USA army teams", "gold_answer": "D", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "Rebuilding scientific, medical, and nursing infrastructure and training staff is crucial for preventing future outbreaks as it strengthens the healthcare system's ability to detect, respond to, and manage infectious diseases effectively."}, "2": {"answer": "C", "explanation": "Developing effective vaccines is another critical measure to prevent future outbreaks of Ebola, as vaccines can provide immunity to the virus and help control its spread."}}}, {"question": "Which of the following coronaviruses has caused thousands of deaths around the world as an 'emergent' virus? (A) MERS (B) SARS (C) OC43 (D) HKU1", "gold_answer": "A", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "B", "explanation": "SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is a well-known coronavirus that caused a global outbreak in 2002-2003, resulting in thousands of deaths and being classified as an 'emergent' virus."}, "2": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) is another coronavirus that has caused significant illness and death, particularly in the Middle East, but it is less commonly associated with being an 'emergent' virus compared to SARS."}}}, {"question": "Which of the following HPV viruses are known to cause cervical cancer? (A) Viruses of all 5 clades (B) Types 14, 16, 18, 31, 45 (C) None are oncogenic per se (D) Types 1-180", "gold_answer": "C", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "B", "explanation": "Types 14, 16, 18, 31, and 45 of HPV are known to be high-risk types associated with cervical cancer."}, "2": {"answer": "C", "explanation": "None of the HPV types are oncogenic per se; they require co-factors to cause cancer, but certain types (like 16 and 18) are more likely to lead to cervical cancer."}}}, {"question": "Why are drug combinations essential for HIV? (A) Single drugs are not completely inhibitory (B) Mutations negate the effect of one drug (C) Combinations of antibiotics are effective versus TB (D) The virus cannot mutate vs a combination", "gold_answer": "C", "reasoning": {"1": {"answer": "A", "explanation": "Single drugs are not completely inhibitory because HIV has the ability to mutate, making it resistant to individual drugs. Therefore, combinations are used to overcome resistance and ensure the virus is effectively inhibited."}, "2": {"answer": "D", "explanation": "Drug combinations are essential for HIV treatment because the virus can mutate to resist single drugs. A combination of drugs makes it harder for the virus to mutate and develop resistance against all drugs in the regimen, increasing the effectiveness of the treatment."}}}]
